    <p>National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. The first national park, Yellowstone, was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."</p>

    <p>Criteria for the selection of National Parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities. National Monuments, on the other hand, are frequently chosen for their historical or archaeological significance. Twenty-seven states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the United States Virgin Islands. California has the most with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four.</p>
